# Music-Generation

This project was done part of a project course in my master's program in Aalto University. The Layout of the project follows similar steps that L. Angioloni et al. had done in their paper "CONLON: A PSEUDO-SONG GENERATOR BASED ON A NEW PIANOROLL, WASSERSTEIN AUTOENCODERS, AND OPTIMAL INTERPOLATIONS
"

The project compares two different autoencoders (variational and Wasserstein) by their ability to generate coherent back ground music. See the project report for more information.
