# Music-Generation

This project was done part of a project course in my master's program in Aalto University. The Layout of the project follows similar stepts that L. Angioloni et al. had done in their paper "CONLON:APSEUDO-SONGGENERATORBASEDONANEW PIANOROLL,WASSERSTEINAUTOENCODERS,ANDOPTIMAL INTERPOLATIONS
"

The project compares two different autoencoders (variational and Wasserstein) by their ability to generate coherent back ground music. See the project report for more information.
